How Startups Can Benefit from Psychometric Tests in Hiring
Startups face their own unique challenges of hiring, and finding the right talent remains atop those hurdles. Stakes are at an all-time high as each person walks through the door to be part of the team, and into a position to begin shaping the future course of the company. Resumes and interviews help display talents and qualifications a candidate has acquired in life, but they do hardly anything to showcase what’s behind a person – their personality, behavior, attitudes, and culture. This is where psychometric assessments prove worthwhile.
In this blog, we’ll dive right into the reasons why startups should go for such assessment in their recruitment process and how platforms such as Think Exam can give businesses an edge over their competitors.

What is Psychometric Testing?
Psychometric tests are defined standardized tools to measure cognitive capacity as well as personality and/or behavioral dispositions of candidates. They are household measures in gaining insight into whether a person can be suited to a certain position.

Because startups require all employees to be in sync with the mission and values of the organization, psychometric testing will give data-driven evidence to arrive at hiring decisions.

Reasons startups need psychometric tests:
Hiring Accuracy Has Increased
Due to resource constraints in new businesses, almost every recruitment brings a boatload of risk. Psychometric tests are used in identifying candidates who not only have sufficient technical competency but also soft skills as well as personality features that are essential for a high-speed startup environment.

Cultural Fit Assessment
The culture in startups is unique in itself and also changes very swiftly. Psychometric tests can act as a tool for understanding how a candidate’s values, their work style, and even interpersonal skills match with the values of the company, toning down the effects of hiring someone that will disrupt the whole team dynamic.

Eliminating Bias in Hiring
Most of the traditional methods of hiring have various unconscious biases attached to them. The candidates will be examined through the psychometric tests objectively and not judging them on mere perceptions.

Higher Employee Retention
Costs can be incurred in hiring the wrong person, as indeed could be the possible effect on team morale. After all this, psychometric testing goes a long way in ensuring that the hiring is done correctly from the outset, which is likely to translate into reduced turnover and increased satisfaction among employees.

Streamlined Recruitment Process
Think Exam is an online platform that enables startups to incorporate psychometric testing into a recruitment pipeline seamlessly and thereby assists them with time savings against extensive evaluation processes and actionable insight.

What Think Exam does for startups that gives them an edge

Scalable Solutions: Hiring that first team or growing fast? Then Think Exam’s flexible solutions would grow in exactly the same ways as these two scenarios.
Real Success Stories from Real Startups
A case in point is that many of the startups are already using psychometric testing. Here are two:

Case Study 1: A company that is starting experimentation towards the use of psychometric assessment tools of Think Exam in identifying problem-solving abilities-ensuring hires that can respond to the Turks of a dynamic industry.
